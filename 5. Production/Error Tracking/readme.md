We use [Bugsnag](https://app.bugsnag.com) to track errors in our products.

It supports all of the languages and platforms we use to build applications.
 
Error alerts point to the line of code where the error occurred further narrowing down the debugging process. 

These alerts are sent to the [#bugsnag-production](https://andela.slack.com/messages/bugsnag-production) Slack channel, to make it easy to stay on top of errors.
